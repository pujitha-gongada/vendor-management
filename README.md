This project demonstrates the implementation of a Vendor Contract Agent using Salesforce Autolaunched Flows, designed to manage and automate vendor contract lifecycle operations.

The solution focuses on:

Tracking vendor contracts in a structured manner

Monitoring contract status (Active, Expiring Soon, Expired)

Automating renewal-related actions and updates

By leveraging Salesforce automation, the system reduces manual effort, minimizes the risk of missed renewals, and improves contract visibility for stakeholders.

 Key Features

Autolaunched Flow Automation for contract status updates

Custom Objects for Vendor and Vendor Contract management

Automated status monitoring based on contract end dates

Scalable design suitable for real-world business environments
